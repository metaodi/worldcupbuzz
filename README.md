worldcupbuzz
============

During the Liip Hackday we implemented a twitter visualization for the football worldcup in Brazil. The idea was to have each new tweet pop-up on a map corresponding to the stadium of the game.
It contains two parts:

1. Getting the data out of twitter (run using `node worker.js`)
2. Put it on a map (run using `node index.js`)

After that you can visit http://localhost:9998/map/ and see the map with the appearing tweets.
